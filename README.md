# clientManagement_v2_Backup
This is a full backup of the Client Management (clientManagement_v2) system prior to the database update. The update changed most code involving database calls and GUI structure/variables. A backup will not be made for each update, but this one changed enough to warrant it.

The "database update": This was when we moved from using a test database to a "final" database. This changed all database names/variables and how calls were made, tables were created, and data accessed.

Before (This is the code in this backup): All tables were created prior to execution of anycode, and the only changes were inserts/deletes. All table names were test names, with test variables/column names.

After (The live repository): All client tables and subtables are generated by the code. This database scheme will be the base for the final database configuration.
